✅ Ideation Phase

The idea for this project started with the need to simplify and digitalize the process of managing family expenses. Instead of using notebooks or Excel sheets, I planned to create a solution using ServiceNow, where all expenses could be recorded, stored, and calculated automatically. The main objective was to develop a ServiceNow-based custom application that allows family members to enter daily expenses, categorize them, and view total spending for a day, week, or month. This system would provide better control over finances, generate automatic monthly reports, and present analytics through dashboards within the ServiceNow platform.
