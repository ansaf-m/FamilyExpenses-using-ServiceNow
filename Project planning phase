✅ Project Planning Phase

The project was planned and executed step by step. First, I finalized the scope and requirements of the project. Then I designed the table, fields, and form layout in ServiceNow. After that, I added the business logic using Business Rules, Script Includes, and Client Scripts to perform automatic calculations. Later, I designed visual reports and dashboards for better understanding of spending patterns. After development, I tested the application thoroughly and made necessary improvements. Finally, the project was prepared for deployment using update sets.
